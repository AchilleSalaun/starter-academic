The recent pandemy definitely taught us that social relationships are precious
both from a personal and scientific point of view.
Therefore, here is a small suggestion of topics I would be happy to discuss 
if we meet around a cup of coffee (it can be a glass of water as well):


<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>
      Of course, we can chat about **science**. 
      I would be glad to know more about your current research 
      and answer any of your questions about mine.
    </th>
    <th>
      {{<figure src="whatever.jpg">}} 
    </th> 
  </tr>
</table>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>
      {{<figure src="whatever.jpg">}}  
    </th>
    <th>

      I hope I can go back on pistes soon !
