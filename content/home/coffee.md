The recent pandemic definitely taught us that social relationships are precious
from both a personal and scientific point of view.
Therefore, here are some topics I would be happy to discuss
if we meet around a cup of coffee (it can be a glass of water as well)!

    Naturally, we can chat about <strong>research</strong>.
    I would be glad to know more about your current works
    and answer any of your questions about mine
    (but you can already start by asking them there :point_right:
    {{< obfuscated_email "<v pynff='snf sn-rairybcr ce-1 sn-sj'></v>" >}}).

    In my spare time, I love <strong>drawing</strong> on my pen tablet:
    you can have a look on my creations there :point_right:

    One of my dreams would be to draw my own comic book. Who knows, maybe one day?

    I am fond of <strong>fencing</strong>, an activity that can be a sport, a game, and an art at the same time.
    When I'm not on the pistes, I can also enjoy a good run from time to time.
