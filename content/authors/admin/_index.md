I am a graduate Télécom Paris engineer since 2017.
In particular, I followed the EURECOM cursus where I specialized in Data Science from 2015-2017.
I received a PhD in computational mathematics (_mathématiques aux interfaces_ in French) from the Institut Polytechnique de Paris.
This was an industrial PhD (CIFRE) with [Télécom SudParis (SAMOVAR)](https://samovar.telecom-sudparis.eu/) and [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) supervised by {{< mention "francois" >}}, {{< mention "anne" >}}, {{< mention "marco" >}}, and {{< mention "yohan" >}}.
My work was about predicting alarms in networks via space-time pattern matching
and machine learning.

I recently defended my thesis and am eager to take my next step in the research world!
In particular, I feel like I still have a lot to discover from both a human and scientific perspective.
Therefore, **I am currently looking for a postDoc abroad** (ideally in Eastern Asia).

Feel free to reach out to me at {{< obfuscated_email "npuvyyrfnynha@tznvy.pbz">}}.
