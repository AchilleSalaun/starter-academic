I recently defended my thesis and am eager to make my next step in the research world!
In particular, I feel I have still a lot to discover both from a human and scientific perspective.
**Therefore, I am currently looking for a postDoc abroad (ideally in Eastern Asia).**

These years have been the opportunity for me to cross various scientific domains 
such as pattern matching and generative models 
applied to alarm log analysis in telecommunication networks.
I really liked this multidisciplinary aspect,
so I would like to enlarge my understanding of these fields by tackling new applications and new problems!

Feel free to reach me at [achillesalaun@gmail.com](mailto:achillesalaun@gmail.com).
