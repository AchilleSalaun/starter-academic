I recently defend my thesis and am eager to make my next step in the research world !
In particular, I feel I have still a lot to discover both from a human and scientific perspective.
Therefore, I am currently looking for a postDoc abroad (ideally in Eastern Asia).

My PhD is about predicting alarms in networks through space-time pattern matching and machine learning.
It is an industrial PhD between 
[SAMOVAR (Télécom SudParis)](https://samovar.telecom-sudparis.eu/) 
and [Nokia Bell Labs](http://www.bell-labs.com/),
supervised by 
[François Desbouvries](http://www-public.it-sudparis.eu/~desbouvr/), 
[Anne Bouillard](https://www.lincs.fr/people/anne-bouillard/), 
[Marc-Olivier Buob](http://marcolivier.buob.pagesperso-orange.fr/), 
and [Yohan Petetin](http://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~petetin/).

These years have been the opportunity for me to cross various scientific domains 
such as pattern matching and generative models 
applied to alarm log analysis in telecommunication networks.
I would like to enlarge my understanding of these fields by tackling new applications and new problems.
