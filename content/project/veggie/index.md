Veggie is Python framework allowing to manipulates tries, automaton and more generally data structure used in language theory. In particular, it provides an implementation of our
algorithms related to DIG-DAG.

This work has been at the core of a collaboration with Nokia's business units.  

This library is based on [Pybgl](https://github.com/nokia/PyBGL).
