# Additional Notes (for me)

This repository is bounded to the repository [https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/starter-academic](https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/starter-academic): it is used to modify and deploy my [personal webpage](https://achillesalaun.github.io/) through the repository [https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/achillesalaun.github.io](https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/achillesalaun.github.io).

Hence, to update my personal webpage, make your changes and push to [https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/starter-academic](https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/starter-academic).
Then,

## If you are on Windows

Run the following command lines in a Power Shell:

Go to your working directory.
For instance:

```
D: ;
cd .\Achille\Travail\Git\page_perso\ ;
```

Build the webpage by running Hugo:

```
hugo ;
```

Commit the generated changes made by Hugo:

```
$date = Get-Date ;
cd .\public\ ;
git add . ;
git commit -m "Deploy [$date]" ;
git push origin master ;
```

You are done!

You can have a look at the deployment status of the webpage [here](https://github.com/AchilleSalaun/achillesalaun.github.io/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages).

Obviously, make sure you have all the credentials required to push on the different repositories.

**Note:** sometimes, Hugo's module cache needs to be cleared:
```
hugo mod clean
hugo server
```

## If you are on Linux

Once Hugo is installed with:

```
sudo snap install hugo
```

(If you issues with the path of the installation, please check [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/hugo-installed-with-a-snap-doesnt-work/6472/10).)

Go to your working directory and make your changes.
For instance in my case:

```
cd [PATH]/starter-academic
```

Once you're happy with your work, visualise it by running:

```
hugo server
```

If you're really happy about your work: commit and push the changes from your working directory.
Then, compile the changes with the command

```
hugo
```

before to go in the public sub-directory:

```
cd ./public
```

where you can commit and push the changes made by Hugo.

If you are setting up a new working directory, you may have to re-set up that second git repository again.
In that case, help can be found [here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7).
